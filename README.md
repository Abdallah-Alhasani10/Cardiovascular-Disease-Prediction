# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This project aims to **predict the occurrence of cardiovascular disease** in patients based on their **medical records** and **lifestyle habits**.  
Using machine learning models, the system analyzes patient data and estimates the **probability of heart disease** occurrence.

## üìä Project Overview

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide.  
Early detection through predictive modeling can help in timely prevention and treatment.

This project uses a dataset containing patients‚Äô medical history, health conditions, and lifestyle indicators to train various classification models and evaluate their performance.
